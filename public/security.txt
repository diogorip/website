I take security flaws seriously and appreciate you helping keep the community safer by reporting them responsibly.

To report a security issue, drop me a line at [safety@luvsick.gg](mailto:safety@luvsick.gg). I'll get back to you if I need more details or have questions about fixing the issue.

Found a security bug in a third-party module? Please report it directly to the people maintaining that module instead of me as they'll be in a better position to address it.
